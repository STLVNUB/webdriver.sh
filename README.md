<pre><code>bash&nbsp;<(curl&nbsp;-s&nbsp;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vulgo/webdriver.sh/v1.5.7/get)</code></pre>

#### Changes in 1.5

- Preferred method of running incompatible drivers is the [WhateverGreen](https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen) ngfxcompat=1 boot argument
- Auto-staging of GPU companion bundles is deterministic based on your current configuration
- New --stage option to override deterministic behaviour
- Single file to download, run and modify
- Runs on 10.14 Mojave, now wait for [drivers](https://vulgo.github.io/nvidia-drivers) from NVIDIA
